    A podcast is an episodic series of spoken word digital audio files that a user can download to a personal
    device for easy listening. Streaming applications and podcasting services provide a convenient and 
    integrated way to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and playback devices.
    A podcast series usually features one or more recurring hosts engaged in a discussion about a particular 
    topic or current event. Discussion and content within a podcast can range from carefully scripted to completely 
    improvised. Podcasts combine elaborate and artistic sound production with thematic concerns ranging from 
    scientific research to slice-of-life journalism. Many podcast series provide an associated website 
    with links and show notes, guest biographies, transcripts, additional resources, commentary,
    and even a community forum dedicated to discussing the show's content.<br><br>

    The cost to the consumer is low. While many podcasts are free to download,
    some are underwritten by corporations or sponsored, with the inclusion of commercial advertisements.
    In other cases, a podcast could also be a business venture supported by some combination of a paid 
    subscription model, advertising or product delivered after sale.
    People are motivated to create a podcast for a number of reasons.<br><br>

    The podcast producer, who is often the podcast host as well, may wish to express a personal passion, 
    increase professional visibility, enter into a social network of influencers or influential ideas,
    cultivate a community of like-minded viewership, or put forward pedagogical or ideological ideas
    (possibly under philanthropic support).
